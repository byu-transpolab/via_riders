abstract: |
  On-demand microtransit services are frequently seen as an important tool in
  supporting first and last mile operations surrounding fixed route high
  frequency transit facilities, but questions remain surrounding who will use
  these novel services and for what purposes. In November 2019, the Utah Transit
  Authority launched an on-demand microtransit service in south Salt Lake County
  in partnership with a private mobility operator. This paper reports the
  results of a survey of 130 transit riders in the microtransit service area
  collected before and immediately after the service launched. There is not a
  clear relationship between current transit access mode and expressed
  willingness to use microtransit, though some responses from new riders
  indicate the novel service competes most directly with commercial
  transportation network company operations. The survey responses also reveal
  younger passengers express more than expected willingness to use microtransit,
  middle-aged passengers a less than expected willingness, and older passengers
  neutral or no expressed opinion. The effect of other user characteristics
  including income and automobile availability is less statistically clear and
  requires further research.
