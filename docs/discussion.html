<h1><span class="header-section-number"> 4</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>We readily acknowledge several limitations of this study, particularly in the
survey design and methodology. The interviews were conducted as a convenience
sample rather than with a rigorous sampling strategy, with the statistical
caveats resulting from that design decision. The sample is also too small to
have substantial statistical power, particularly in statistics calculated on
multiple grouping dimensions. Finally, the survey collected self-reported
responses with no verification or validation of any kind.</p>
<p>Most survey responses were collected on fixed rail transit station platforms.
Passengers waiting for UTA trains were expected to be both more available to
respond to survey questions, as well as more likely to use the microtransit
service than the general population. Additionally, UTA is interested in
supporting its fixed rail transit investments in the service area. There is,
however, no requirement that microtransit passengers use other UTA services;
data supplied by the microtransit provider but not included in this study
suggest that only 58% percent of microtransit trips began or ended within 500
feet of a UTA rail transit station. This population might have preferences or
patterns that either match or contradict the initial findings of this research.</p>
<p>In discussing the responses to the question of what mode microtransit passengers
would have used were the service not available, we suggested there is anecdotal
evidence that commercial TNC rides are the primary competition. There are still
questions, however, of how use of this service might affect conventional transit
services. Table  shows the average weekday ridership
during November, December, and January for the period the microtransit service
was operating as well as the same three months in the two prior years
. Total system ridership was remarkably stable during
these three periods. The microtransit service area – in this case defined by
ridership on routes F514, 218, 526, F504, F518, F534, F546, and F547 – was
declining before the microtransit service began, though the decline accelerated
during the first three months of the service’s operation. By comparison, the
microtransit service carried approximately 316 passengers per day during its
first three months, more than compensating for the recent observed decline in
transit ridership were this to be identified as a major contributing factor.</p>

<p>Another limitation of these findings that is particularly relevant is the onset
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Government-imposed shutdowns and voluntary work
stoppages related to the pandemic did not begin in Utah until the week of March
15th, after data collection for this project had completed. As such, the survey
responses are likely unaffected by changes in behavior related to the pandemic.
However, the pandemic has drastically affected the subsequent operations of both
UTA and Via and is likely to change many of the stated behaviors and attitudes
reported in this study. Many findings of this study will need to be reconsidered
should “normal” operations resume.</p>
<p>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
## Conclusion</p>
<p>Microtransit services are regularly put forward as means to support last-mile /
first-mile trips on fixed route transit systems, and several such systems have
been deployed in the recent past. This paper presented initial findings from a
quick response survey aimed at learning who was most willing to use the new
service within weeks of the system launch. These initial findings suggest first
that younger adults are most willing to consider using microtransit services,
and that these services compete most directly with commercial TNC ridehail
offerings rather than conventional transit.</p>
<p>Transit passenger intercept surveys are an important method to determine who is
and who is not using a microtransit service, paired with demographic
characteristics and trip purpose information. To understand the rider
characteristics and trip purposes specifically of microtransit users, by
contrast, better survey methods are needed. In particular, a survey pushed
through the smartphone application used by the passengers would help in reaching
a considerably larger sample. It would also be theoretically possible in that
case for the researchers to pair the survey responses with actual observed trip
patterns for distinct users including origin, destination, and route GPS points,
regularity of use and variance in use patterns, and many other data variables.
Obtaining these data and conducting responsible research with them should be a
priority for the service operators and their agency partners.</p>
