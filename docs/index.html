<p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
<p>On-demand microtransit services are frequently seen as an important tool in
supporting first and last mile operations surrounding fixed route high
frequency transit facilities, but questions remain surrounding who will use
these novel services and for what purposes. In November 2019, the Utah Transit
Authority launched an on-demand microtransit service in south Salt Lake County
in partnership with a private mobility operator. This paper reports the
results of a survey of 130 transit riders in the microtransit service area
collected before and immediately after the service launched. There is not a
clear relationship between current transit access mode and expressed
willingness to use microtransit, though some responses from new riders
indicate the novel service competes most directly with commercial
transportation network company operations. The survey responses also reveal
younger passengers express a more than expected willingness to use microtransit,
middle-aged passengers a less than expected willingness, and older passengers
neutral or no expressed opinion. Results suggest additional relationships
between household size and transit use frequency, but further research is
necessary. The effect of other user characteristics including income and
automobile availability is less statistically clear and also requires further
research.</p>

<div id="intro" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number"> 1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Transit ridership in the United States has been in decline over the last several
years, with underlying causes ranging from service cuts to the advent of new
mobility options <span class="citation">(Graehler, Mucci, and Erhardt <a href="#ref-Graehler2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Mallet <a href="#ref-Mallett2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. These new mobility options –
including bikeshare, e-scooters, and ridehailing through Transportation Network
Companies (TNCs) – might also play an important role in supporting transit
operations if the relative strengths of transit and modern mobility systems can
be successfully partnered <span class="citation">(Shaheen and Chan <a href="#ref-Shaheen2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>; Oostendorp and Gebhardt <a href="#ref-OOSTENDORP201872" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; Shiv <a href="#ref-ShivThesis" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>One particular area where a partnership between high-capacity, fixed-route
transit and TNC operations has been desired is in supporting first mile / last
mile operations in low-density suburban regions <span class="citation">(Shaheen and Chan <a href="#ref-Shaheen2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>; Alonso-González et al. <a href="#ref-alonso2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; Kang and Hamidi <a href="#ref-Kang2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. TNC operators are incentivized to operate in dense areas where many
potential passengers are located <span class="citation">(Wong, Hensher, and Mulley <a href="#ref-Wong2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, meaning they compete with transit
where transit can be most successful. But regulations or partnerships that
changed this incentive pattern could be highly beneficial to many transit riders
<span class="citation">(Ronald, Thompson, and Winter <a href="#ref-Ronald2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>; Deakin, Frick, and Shively <a href="#ref-Deakin2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. For example, a transit agency might partner with a
TNC to offer shared rides at a subsidized fare in low-density areas where fixed
route transit services are ineffective or expensive. As these partnerships to
offer microtransit services materialize through demonstration projects or
permanent offerings, there is an important opportunity to observe and evaluate
who is using the service and for what reasons. It is also valuable to understand
how users perceive the effectiveness and convenience of these systems.</p>
<p>In this paper we report the results of a survey conducted immediately before and
several weeks after the November 2019 launch of a microtransit service in south
Salt Lake County, Utah by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA). The surveys were
primarily designed to understand the awareness of the on-demand system in the
transit passenger community. The surveys also consider the stated and revealed
likeliness of individuals to use the microtransit service, and how the
characteristics of these individuals –– particularly age, transit use frequency,
and household size — influence these preferences.</p>
<p>The remainder of this section contains a brief review of previous and ongoing
studies relevant to the question of demand for and use of microtransit services.
We then describe the survey methodology for this study, including both the
context of the UTA microtransit service as well as the survey instrument and
collection strategy. The survey results in several dimensions are followed by a
discussion of the limitations of the findings and associated opportunities for
future research.</p>
<div id="findings-from-other-systems" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Findings from Other Systems</h2>
<p>In the last few years a number of on-demand microtransit services have begun
operations in many cities around the world. Given the dynamic nature of this
space, the literature is not mature and numerous projects are under evaluation
at the moment. However, some findings from early systems are available and are
worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>A microtransit service in Helsinki, Finland known as “Kutsuplus” operated from
2012 to 2015 and has been the subject of a number of studies. <span class="citation">Weckström et al. (<a href="#ref-weckstrom2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> and
<span class="citation">Haglund et al. (<a href="#ref-Haglund2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> each conduct a comprehensive analysis of the system using rider
questionnaires supplemented with GPS data points. The studies found that the
system was used by a wide variety of individuals for a wide variety of trip
purposes, and the typical trip length suggested it was being used less like a
taxi service and more to supplement last-mile transit access. In many cases, it
appeared as though Kutsuplus replaced walking and bicycle trips. The
<span class="citation">Weckström et al. (<a href="#ref-weckstrom2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> research also asked respondents why they may have continued or
discontinued using the service, revealing strong differences in response among
different income groups. High-income individuals were more likely to cite long
response times, while lower income groups were more likely to cite the fare or
difficulties understanding the service, or even not being aware of its
existence.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Alonso-González et al. (<a href="#ref-alonso2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> examined a microtransit system in the Arnhem-Nijmegen region in the
Netherlands. They develop a methodology to calculate the accessibility
contributed by the microtransit system above and beyond that provided by the
fixed route transit system, and their findings suggest the microtransit
service substantively enhances the mobility of people in the region. In this
study the authors use GPS trip data from the service and do not have access to
the actual riders to understand their preferences or characteristics.</p>
<p>In 2016 Austin, Texas, introduced a TNC operated as a non-profit and called
“RideAustin.” The unique corporate structure of this TNC encourages it to share
data from the system with researchers, leading to a number of studies examining
the trip patterns of its users. <span class="citation">Komanduri et al. (<a href="#ref-Komanduri2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> show that a high proportion of
trips (60%) taken on RideAustin could have been completed with a single-seat
transit ride. <span class="citation">Wenzel et al. (<a href="#ref-Wenzel2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> additionally used the same dataset to estimate the
level of deadheading and concomitant energy expenditure on the system. Though
these findings are important in terms of understanding the risks of microtransit
services, it should be stressed that the RideAustin service was not explicitly designed
to support transit operations. And although the RideAustin dataset does identify
unique individual riders through a persistent mobile device ID, it does not
disclose any demographic information on the riders and therefore cannot support
an analysis of their characteristics or preferences.</p>
<p><span class="citation">König and Grippenkoven (<a href="#ref-KONIG2020954" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> present a survey focused on determining preferences and
attitudes towards demand-responsive transit use in two rural regions in
Germany. A structural equations model of expressed preferences suggests that
users’ attitudes are most powerfully driven by the expected performance of the
system in terms of wait and travel time, and less materially by attitudes
towards other public transit systems or social perspectives. This is valuable
insight, but attitudes such as these are difficult to forecast for a population,
and therefore difficult to incorporate into service planning exercises. The
authors collected demographic characteristics of the survey respondents, but did
not consider these characteristics in the statistical models.</p>
<p>The literature to this point has been greatly aided by the use of so-called Big
Data: GPS records, rider transaction data, and the like. These data are
well-suited to important research questions such as where and when the services
pick up and drop off riders, the wait times experienced by the riders, and in
some cases even the ability to construct multiple trip tours. But the literature
is somewhat limited in its exploration of the actual users of
these systems: who they are, why they are traveling, and why they chose to use
this service. This information is critical when planning and forecasting the
potential success or failure of these systems, in contrast to reporting observed
service characteristics for a service already in operation. In this paper, we
present the results of a rider survey designed to answer these questions in the
periods immediately before and after the launch of a
microtransit service.</p>
