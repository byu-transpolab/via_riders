% If you would like to post an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use preprint as the journal and change 'submit' to 'accept'. The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\)
\abstract{On-demand microtransit services are frequently seen as an important tool in
supporting first and last mile operations surrounding fixed route high
frequency transit facilities, but questions remain surrounding who will use
these novel services and for what purposes. In November 2019, the Utah Transit
Authority launched an on-demand microtransit service in south Salt Lake County
in partnership with a private mobility operator. This paper reports the
results of a survey of 130 transit riders in the microtransit service area
collected before and immediately after the service launched. There is not a
clear relationship between current transit access mode and expressed
willingness to use microtransit, though some responses from new riders
indicate the novel service competes most directly with commercial
transportation network company operations. The survey responses also reveal
younger passengers express more than expected willingness to use microtransit,
middle-aged passengers a less than expected willingness, and older passengers
neutral or no expressed opinion. The effect of other user characteristics
including income and automobile availability is less statistically clear and
requires further research.}
