## System Description
In November 2019, the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) launched an on-demand
microtransit service in the southern part of Salt Lake County. This region –
illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:via-map) – has primarily low-density suburban
development but also hosts stations for UTA's extensive rail transit network:
the FrontRunner commuter rail operates between Provo and Ogden via downtown Salt
Lake City on 30 minute peak headways; and the Blue and Red TRAX light rail lines
connect to downtown Salt Lake City, the University of Utah, and Salt Lake
International Airport (via transfer) on 15 minute peak headways. There are
existing fixed route and route deviation services in the region, as well as park
and ride facilities at most rail stations. UTA is interested in improving the
quality of service for passengers in the region as well as reducing
per-passenger operating costs.

```{r via-map, out.width = '100%', fig.cap="UTA on-demand microtransit service area. Image by the authors"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/service_area.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

In establishing the on-demand microtransit service UTA partnered with Via, a
commercial mobility provider with new and ongoing operations in several US
cities. Passengers request rides using the VIA mobile application or calling a
designated service line and await the vehicle at a pickup point near to their
origin. Passengers share rides based on the availability of vehicles and the
compatibility of paths, as determined by algorithms embedded in the VIA service.
The vehicle will drop the passenger off near their destination or at TRAX or
FrontRunner stations; both the pickup and drop-off points must lie within the
service area shown in Figure \@ref(fig:via-map). The regular adult one-way fare
is \$2.50 and includes a limited transfer to the UTA fixed route transit system.
By the end of February 2020, the microtransit system was carrying about 316
passenger trips per weekday with an average wait time of 11 minutes per trip
@uta2020.

UTA’s primary goal in executing this survey was to understand the effectiveness
of its marketing campaign to raise awareness and information of the new service.
This survey also provided an opportunity to inform additional riders and to
evaluate rider perceptions and characteristics both before and immediately after
the service launch. As such the survey was administered in two tranches. The
first tranche was conducted on November 6th, 13th, and 14th of 2019 through
on-platform intercept interviews at the Draper and South Jordan FrontRunner
stations as well as the Draper Town Center TRAX station. The second tranche was
collected on several weekdays between January 10th and March 4th, 2020, and was
collected through on-platform intercept interviews at the same stations in
addition to the Daybreak Parkway TRAX station and at designated microtransit
pick-up points near the aforementioned rail stations; a limited number of
interviews were also conducted on board the microtransit vehicles. Interviews
were conducted throughout the day, but with a focus on the PM peak commute
period. The number of interviews conducted during each time period for each
tranche is shown in Table \@ref(tab:survey-times).


```{r survey-times}
min_date <- function(df){min(df$Start)}
max_date <- function(df){max(df$Start)}
mean_date <- function(df){mean(df$Start)}
weekday <- function(df){
  df %>%
    transmute(
      weekday = weekdays(Start),
      hour = lubridate::hour(Start),
      period = cut(hour, breaks = c(0, 6, 10, 15, 18, 24 ), 
                   labels = c("Night", "AM (6-10)", "Mid-Day (10-4)", "PM (4-7)", "Evening (7-Midnight)"))) %>%
    group_by(period, weekday) %>% tally()}

out <- survey_data %>%
  mutate(
    n = map_int(data, nrow),
    min_date = as_datetime(map_dbl(data, min_date)),
    max_date = as_datetime(map_dbl(data, max_date)),
    mean_date = as_datetime(map_dbl(data, mean_date)),
    weekdays = map(data, weekday)
  )

out$weekdays %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "tranche") %>%
  mutate(tranche = ifelse(tranche == 1, "Before", "After")) %>%
  group_by(tranche, period) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>%
  spread(tranche, n, fill = 0) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Surveys Collected by Time of Day")
```


The surveys were administered via electronic tablet using a questionnaire
developed in a web-based survey software. The survey questions were developed
with the help of UTA staff and an external consulting team. The relevant
variables and source questions for this study are shown in Table
\ref{tab:survey-summary}, in the order in which the questions were asked. After
asking the respondent about their awareness of the system, the interviewer would
give a brief explanation of the service before asking about the respondent’s
likeliness to use the system. The questionnaire for the second tranche included
additional questions that were identified as being important after the first
tranche was collected; for example, the questions about income and household
size were added between the tranches. Further, questions in the second tranche
for respondents on train platforms and either at or on board the microtransit
service had slightly different wording to reflect the separate contexts. There
was also a set of questions requesting general feedback on the UTA service that
is not included in this study.
